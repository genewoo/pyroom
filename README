====== PyRoom Project ======

PyRoom is a fullscreen simple text editor, without a toolbar, a menubar or anything that would distract the user from his most important task: writing.

===== Dependencies =====

PyRoom depends on Python, PyGTK and gtksourceview. Please refer to your system documentation for information on how to install these modules if they're not currently available.

===== Installing and Running =====

PyRoom is available as a seutptools enabled package. Installation procedures for those are easy:

Either unpack the tarball 
    
    $ tar xvfz pyroom.tar.gz

or check out our bazaar branch for a development version (we try to keep those 
unbroken and ready for production use)
    
    $ bzr branch lp:pyroom

From there, you can either run pyroom from commandline

    $ cd pyroom/
    $ ./pyroom

Or install it system wide

    $ cd pyroom
    $ python setup.py install # as root
    $ pyroom

==== Usage ====

=== Running PyRoom ===

To run pyroom and instruct it to load some existing files, type:

  $ pyroom /path/to/file1 /other/path/to/file2

===Graphical Styles===

The default style is "green", which is a green text color in a black background. You can change the chosen style by typing:

  $ pyroom [--style={style name}]

For instance:

  $ pyroom --style=blue

At the time of writing, the available styles are:
  * blue
  * green
  * darkgreen

=== Example Usage ===

For example, to load PyRoom and instruct it to use the "darkgreen" style and to load the files "article.txt" and "blogpost.txt", type the following:
