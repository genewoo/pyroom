====== PyRoom Project ======

PyRoom is a fullscreen simple text editor, without a toolbar, a menubar or anything that would distract the user from his most important task: writing.

===== Dependencies =====

PyRoom depends on Python, PyGTK and gtksourceview. Please refer to your system documentation for information on how to install these modules if they're not currently available.

===== Installing and Running =====

PyRoom is not currently packaged, so if you want to get the latest chunk of code, you'll have to type the following commands in a console:

  $ bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~brunobord/pyroom/trunk pyroom
  $ cd pyroom
  $ python pyroom.py

==== Usage ====

=== Running PyRoom ===

To run PyRoom, type:

  $ python pyroom.py

To run pyroom and instruct it to load some existing files, type:

  $ python pyroom.py /path/to/file1 /other/path/to/file2

===Graphical Styles===

The default style is "green", which is a green text color in a black background. You can change the chosen style by typing:

  $ python pyroom.py [--style={style name}]

For instance:

  $ python pyroom.py --style=blue

At the time of writing, the available styles are:
  * blue
  * green
  * darkgreen

=== Example Usage ===

For example, to load PyRoom and instruct it to use the "darkgreen" style and to load the files "article.txt" and "blogpost.txt", type the following:

  $ python pyroom.py --style=darkgreen article.txt blog.txt
